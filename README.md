***Exercise 1:***
Study how tensor networks structures can be used to set up a machine learning algorithm (look at
[“Unsupervised Generative Modeling Using Matrix Product States”](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031012)

***Exercise 2:***
Write a tensor network code able to perform generative modeling by means of Matrix Product States
(MPS). If you wish, you can use an open-source library for basic tensors operations, such as [TenPy](https://tenpy.readthedocs.io), [iTensor](http://itensor.org) or similar.

***Exercise 3:***
Test your code to reproduce the main results contained in the reference paper.
